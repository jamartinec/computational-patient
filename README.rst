PK/PD Model for Diabetic kidney disease and SARS-CoV-2
=======================================================

A mathematical model of glucose-stimulated local
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in podocytes [1][2][3] combined
with a PKPD model of ACE inhibition of the RAS [4][5]
adjusted for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
